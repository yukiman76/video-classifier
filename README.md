**Video Classification using LLM and Web Scraping**
======================================================

**Overview**

This code demonstrates a proof-of-concept (POC) for classifying YouTube videos using a Large Language Model (LLM) and web scraping. The script extracts the audio transcription from a YouTube video, sends it to an LLM for classification, and prints the response.

**Dependencies**

* `ollama`: a Python library for interacting with LLMs
* `thepipe`: a Python library for web scraping and data processing
* `pytube`: a Python library for YouTube video handling (required for `thepipe`)

**How to Use**

1. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requrements.txt`.
2. Create a `prompt.md` file in the same directory as this script, containing the prompt for the LLM.
3. Update the `surl` variable in the script to point to the YouTube video you want to classify.
4. Run the script using `python run.py`.
5. The script will extract the audio transcription from the video, send it to the LLM, and print the response.

**Notes**

* The script uses the `llama3.1:70b` model, which is a specific LLM model. You may need to adjust the model or prompt depending on your specific use case.
* The script only extracts the text from the video transcription and sends it to the LLM. You may want to extract additional metadata or features from the video for more accurate classification.
* The script uses `IPython.embed()` to drop into an interactive shell after running. This is optional and can be removed if not needed.

** Issues**

* If you encounter issues with `pytube` and YouTube video handling, refer to the [pytube GitHub issue #1750](https://github.com/pytube/pytube/issues/1750) for solutions.
